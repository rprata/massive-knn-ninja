MASSIVE-KNN-NINJA: A Simple List Implementation
=======================================

What is it?
-----------

Is my first work data structure. This course is lected by Flavio in UERJ. This software works in Linux and Windows platform and.


How does it work?
-----------------

Select in file setup.txt and put the arguments. For example:

	Dados/C-HEART1.txt
	Dados/C-HEART2.txt
	7
	2

, where first and second line are the file (main and test), line three is the K value and last line is the number of classes. For more information about KNN algorithm: [wiki-knn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbor_algorithm)
